# Introduction to HTML Markdown

### What is HTML Markdown?
HTML Markdown is a markup language used to create web pages. It is a simple and easy-to-learn language that allows developers to create web pages with text, images, links, and other elements.

### Basics of HTML Markdown
HTML Markdown is made up of a series of tags that are used to define the structure and content of a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and can have attributes that provide additional information about the element.

Here's an example of a basic HTML Markdown document:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First HTML Markdown Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first HTML Markdown document.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

This document includes the basic structure of an HTML Markdown document, with tags like <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body>.

### Syntax of HTML Markdown
HTML Markdown uses a simple syntax to define tags and attributes. Here's an example of a basic tag:

```
<tagname>Content goes here</tagname>
```

Tags can also have attributes that provide additional information about the element. Attributes are added to the opening tag and have a name and a value:

```
<tagname attribute="value">Content goes here</tagname>
```

### Semantics in HTML Markdown
Semantics refers to the meaning or purpose of an element in HTML Markdown. By using semantic elements, you can provide additional meaning and structure to your web page.

Here are some examples of semantic elements:
<header>: Defines a header for a section or document.
<nav>: Defines a set of navigation links.
<section>: Defines a section of a document.
<article>: Defines an article or blog post.
<footer>: Defines a footer for a section or document.

Using semantic elements can help improve the accessibility and SEO of your web page, as well as make it easier to understand and maintain.

### Most Used HTML Markdown Tags and Attributes
Here are some of the most commonly used HTML Markdown tags and the attributes that they should always have:

*** Standards required ***
<html>: Defines the root of an HTML document. Should always have the lang attribute to specify the language of the document.
<head>: Defines the head section of a web page. Should always have the <title> tag to specify the title of the page.
<body>: Defines the body section of a web page.


<h1> to <h6>: Defines heading levels. Should always have a corresponding level of hierarchy, meaning <h1> should always be the top heading.
<p>: Defines a paragraph.
<a>: Defines a hyperlink. Should always have the href attribute to specify the link target.
<img>: Defines an image. Should always have the src attribute to specify the image source and the alt attribute to provide alternative text for the image.
